\title{Implements the regularization functions used in the estimation}
\usage{
toy_regularization(left_index, right_index, n, m)
}
\description{
The estimator in this package computes the optimum of
\eqn{-l(C, p) + \lambda*R(leftIndex, rightIndex, n, m)}, where l is the
log likelihood of the family, lambda is the penalization constant and R
is the regularization function. The user can create his own regularization
function and pass as an argument to \link[fit_blockcpd]{fit_blockcpd}. It
should have four arguments, in the following order: leftIndex, rightIndex, n
(the sample size) and m (the number of columns or variables).
If the function depends on leftIndex and rightIndex, it will be
non-homogeneous, which might be interesting in some applications.
The package implements some functions as an example, but uses only
bic_loss_hs as the default. The algorithm is consistent as long as the
the regularization is bounded by a constant.

my_reg <- function(leftIndex, rightIndex, n, m){
    block_size = (rightIndex - leftIndex + 1)
    return(log(n*m)*(1/block_size))
