Description: The blockcpd package implements statistical models based on 
    regularized likelihood to perform offline change point detection when working
    with multiple aligned independent time series. It detects changes in 
    parameters for the specified family, so in a sense it detects 
    "blocks of random variables" which have the same parameter.
